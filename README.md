# Hues - The Color Plugin
### Enhancing Your Ghidra Experience with Hues
Welcome to the Ghidra Hues Plugin repository! If you're looking for a way to make your reverse engineering environment more vibrant and visually appealing, you're in the right place. This plugin brings a pop of color to the Ghidra interface, making it not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.

### Repository Status Update
I made this plugin per a request of "[Issue #13](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/13)", authored under my alternate username at the time, "[@quosego](https://github.com/quosego)", when Ghidra was first released. Now, this concept is now apart of Ghidra's "General Theming" thus making this repository to be officially archived.
